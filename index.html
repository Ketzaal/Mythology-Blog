<p id="mainArticle">For thousands of years, mythology guided human consciousness through the vast uknown. Myth was the torch that illumanted the depths of our unconcsious allowing us to express ideas and 
rules for living when words were just not enough. With the aid of symbols and archetypes, myth opened the doors for us to explore the depths of our own minds and consequently the world 
around us. However, it seems that purposeful story-telling (that which makes use of symbols and archetypes) and an interest in myth has waned in recent years. The purpose of this site is to 
rekindle the amazment and wonder of not just the world but our own psyche through myth.</p>
